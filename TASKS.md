## Front-End Architecture Review — Task Details (added Jun 2026)

### #96 · Split `fhir-client.ts` into domain modules ✅ Done
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** Medium · **File:** `src/lib/fhir-client.ts` (5,341 lines)

Refactor into a domain-scoped module tree. Add a barrel `index.ts` that re-exports everything so no call sites need to change on day one.

**Completed Jun 2026.** `src/lib/fhir-client.ts` is now a 3-line barrel (`export * from "./fhir"`). All implementation lives in:

```
src/lib/fhir/
  client.ts        # fhirRequest(), fhirFetch(), URL resolution, shared constants
  patients.ts      # patient CRUD, search, photo, merge, vitals, observations
  encounters.ts    # encounter lifecycle, SOAP notes, encounter search
  medications.ts   # MedicationRequest, MAR, discharge Rx, inpatient Rx
  orders.ts        # lab, radiology, procedures, diagnostics, tasks, documents, referrals
  appointments.ts  # appointment CRUD and status transitions
  clinical.ts      # allergies, conditions, immunizations, flags, family history, directives, QRs
  admin.ts         # practitioners, organizations, roles, locations, healthcare services, devices
  subscriptions.ts # subscriptions and notification bundles
  display.ts       # patientDisplayName(), status colors, date formatters, dashboard
  index.ts         # re-exports for backward compatibility
```

---

### #97 · Add TanStack Query caching layer
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** High

Every page navigation triggers fresh FHIR fetches. The dashboard uses `force-dynamic` which disables all Next.js caching. Install `@tanstack/react-query`, wrap the app in `QueryClientProvider`, and migrate page-level fetches to `useQuery` / `useMutation`.

```ts
const { data: patient, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['patient', id],
  queryFn: () => getPatient(id),
  staleTime: 30_000,
})
```

Benefits: background refetch, deduplication of concurrent calls, optimistic updates, built-in devtools.

---

### #98 · Fix silent error swallowing — error boundaries + explicit error states
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** High

Multiple components suppress errors with `.catch(() => [])`. In a healthcare context an empty list looks identical to "no data recorded" — a failed medication fetch is invisible to the user.

- Add a React Error Boundary at each major route (`patients/[id]`, `encounters/[id]`)
- Replace silent catches with explicit error state: "Failed to load medications. Retry?"
- Integrate Sentry (or equivalent) for production error visibility

---

### #99 · Move JWT from `localStorage` to `HttpOnly` cookie
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** High · **File:** `src/lib/auth.ts`

`localStorage` is readable by any XSS payload. The token should only live in an `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Secure` cookie set server-side.

1. Add `POST /api/auth/login` — forwards credentials to FHIR auth, sets HttpOnly cookie on response
2. Add `POST /api/auth/logout` — clears the cookie
3. Remove all `localStorage.setItem('auth_token', ...)` calls
4. `src/app/layout.tsx` already reads the cookie server-side — keep that path, remove the localStorage fallback

---

### #100 · Add test coverage — Jest + RTL + Playwright + msw
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** High

Zero test files exist in the repository. Split into four sequential subtasks — complete `#100a` first, then `#100b`–`#100d` can proceed independently.

| Subtask | Layer | Tool | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| #100a | Infrastructure | — | Install all test packages; configure Jest, Playwright, and msw |
| #100b | Unit | Jest + msw | `display.ts` helpers + `searchPatients()` query routing |
| #100c | Component | RTL + msw | `PatientForm` field validation, EMPI lookup, submit; `PatientSearch` debounce + results |
| #100d | E2E | Playwright | Encounter lifecycle: start → SOAP note → close |

---

### #100a · Test infrastructure setup
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** Low · **Blocks:** #100b, #100c, #100d

Install and configure all test tooling. No test files are written in this step.

**Packages to install (devDependencies):**

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom` | Test runner + browser-like DOM |
| `@swc/jest`, `@swc/core` | Fast TypeScript transform (replaces ts-jest) |
| `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/user-event` | RTL + custom matchers + user interaction |
| `msw` | Mock Service Worker — stubs `fetch` at the network layer |
| `@playwright/test` | E2E test runner |
| `@types/jest` | TypeScript types for Jest |

**Files to create:**
- `jest.config.ts` — module name mapper for `@/` alias, `jsdom` environment, `jest.setup.ts` setup file
- `jest.setup.ts` — imports `@testing-library/jest-dom`; starts the msw server
- `src/__tests__/mocks/handlers.ts` — shared msw request handlers for FHIR Bundle stubs
- `playwright.config.ts` — base URL `http://localhost:3000`, one project (chromium), screenshot on failure
- Add `"test": "jest"` and `"test:e2e": "playwright test"` to `package.json` scripts

---

### #100b · Unit tests — display helpers + searchPatients routing
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** Low · **Blocked by:** #100a

Target files: `src/lib/fhir/display.ts`, `src/lib/fhir/patients.ts`

Test file: `src/__tests__/unit/display.test.ts`
- `patientDisplayName` — English name selected over Arabic (language extension), prefix + given + family joined, fallback `"Unknown Patient"`
- `patientAge` — birthday today, month boundary, missing `birthDate` returns `"—"`
- `formatDate` / `formatDateTime` — known date string → expected locale string
- `formatRelativeTime` — use fake timers to freeze `Date.now()` and assert each time band (min, hr, day, month, yr)

Test file: `src/__tests__/unit/searchPatients.test.ts`
- Pure letter input → only `?name=` query fires
- All-digit ≥ 7 chars → `?identifier=` AND `?phone=` both fire
- `MRN-001234` → prefix stripped → `?identifier=001234`
- Short alphanumeric → `?identifier=` only
- Empty string → returns `[]` immediately, no fetch

Use msw handlers from `src/__tests__/mocks/handlers.ts` to return fixture `Bundle` responses.

---

### #100c · Component tests — PatientForm + PatientSearch
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** Medium · **Blocked by:** #100a

Test file: `src/__tests__/components/PatientSearch.test.tsx`
- Type a name → debounce triggers → msw returns a `Bundle` with one patient → patient row renders
- Clearing input → results list disappears
- msw returns empty `Bundle` → "No results" empty state renders

Test file: `src/__tests__/components/PatientForm.test.tsx`
- Submit with empty `givenEn` → required validation error shown, no FHIR call made
- Enter an 11-digit QID → no error; enter 10 digits → QID format error shown
- Fill minimum required fields + submit → `createPatient` fetch intercepted by msw → success toast fires
- Edit mode: form pre-populates with `defaultValues` from the passed `Patient` fixture

---

### #100d · E2E tests — Encounter lifecycle
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** Medium · **Blocked by:** #100a

Runs against the real local HAPI instance (no msw). Requires `npm run dev` or `npm start` running on port 3000.

Test file: `e2e/encounter.spec.ts`

1. **Start encounter** — navigate to a known test patient → click "Start Encounter" → fill service type + chief complaint → confirm → encounter page opens with status `in-progress`
2. **Add SOAP note** — on the encounter page, open the SOAP note form → fill Subjective + Objective + Assessment + Plan → save → note appears in the Notes tab
3. **Close encounter** — click "Close Encounter" → select discharge disposition → confirm → encounter status shows `finished`

### #101 · Add pagination to all list views
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium · **Effort:** Medium

All queries use a hardcoded `_count` (20–50) with no "Next / Load more" control. FHIR bundles expose a `next` link for cursor-based pagination.

- Implement `fetchNextPage(bundle)` helper in `fhir-client.ts`
- Add pagination controls to: patient search, encounter search, and encounter tab cards (conditions, orders, medications)

### #102 · Migrate forms to react-hook-form + Zod
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium · **Effort:** Medium · **File:** `src/components/patients/PatientForm.tsx` and all dialog forms

Manual `useState` across 20+ fields has no per-field dirty/touched tracking and grows fragile. `react-hook-form` gives uncontrolled inputs, built-in dirty tracking, and composable validation. Pair with Zod for both form validation and runtime type-safety on FHIR API responses.

```ts
const patientSchema = z.object({
  givenEn: z.string().min(1, "Required"),
  qid: z.string().regex(/^\d{11}$/, "Must be 11 digits").optional(),
})
```

### #103 · Replace base64 photo storage with URL/Binary reference
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium · **Effort:** Low · **File:** `src/lib/fhir-client.ts` — `updatePatientPhoto()`

Storing photos as inline base64 in `Patient.photo[0].data` inflates every `getPatient()` response by hundreds of KB. Upload photos to a CDN or FHIR `Binary` resource and store only the `url` in `Patient.photo[0]`. Fetch lazily in `PatientPhotoAvatar.tsx`.

---

### #104 · Audit and memoize layout component re-renders
**Priority:** 🟠 Lower · **Effort:** Low · **Files:** `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

These components mount on every page. Profile with React DevTools Profiler to find re-renders triggered by unrelated parent state. Apply `React.memo` to stable sub-components and `useCallback` for handlers passed as props.

---

### #105 · Move hardcoded `inquiryusername` header to config/env
**Priority:** 🟠 Lower · **Effort:** Low · **Status:** ✅ Done

**Completed Jun 2026.** `inquiryusername` is now configured via `src/lib/config.json` under `fhir.server`, with `NEXT_PUBLIC_FHIR_TENANT` as an environment override. `authHeaders()` and the notification receiver both use the shared tenant-header helper.

---

### #106 · Close notification real-time gap
**Priority:** 🟠 Lower · **Effort:** Low · **File:** `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` — notification panel

The panel loads notifications once on mount; the badge count goes stale if a webhook fires while the user is on the page. Options (pick one):

- **Short polling:** `setInterval(() => fetchNotifications(), 30_000)` inside a `useEffect` with cleanup
- **SSE:** Stream events from `src/app/api/fhir/notify/route.ts` via `ReadableStream`
- **WebSocket:** Connect directly if the FHIR server supports `$websocket-notify`

---

### #107 · Verify `Select.onValueChange` `v ?? ""` coalescing is consistent
**Priority:** 🟠 Lower · **Effort:** Low

CLAUDE.md documents that `onValueChange` must coerce `null` to `""`. A missed coerce silently stores `null` in state where a string is expected. Audit all usages:

```
grep -rn "onValueChange" src/ --include="*.tsx"
```

Fix any handler that does not apply `v ?? ""`.

### #108 · LLM assistant — natural-language appointment management and clinical-document generation
**Priority:** 🔴 High · **Effort:** High

Add an LLM-powered assistant that handles two distinct interaction modes, both surfaced through a single chat-style prompt bar in the UI.

---

#### Use case 1 — Natural-language appointment commands

The user types a free-text instruction such as:
- *"List tomorrow's appointments after 10 AM"*
- *"Cancel my appointments for today after 1 PM"*

The LLM interprets intent, extracts structured parameters (date, time range, action), and the app executes the corresponding FHIR operations — then renders results inline.

**Implementation outline:**

1. **Prompt bar UI** — a floating or sidebar input accepting free text; visible from the appointments page and the dashboard. Place in `src/components/llm/LlmAssistant.tsx` (`"use client"`).
2. **API route** — `POST /api/llm/appointment-command` receives `{ prompt, context }` (context = today's date, current practitioner ID, timezone `Asia/Qatar`). Never send PHI beyond what is needed to resolve the command.
3. **LLM call** — send a system prompt describing available actions and expected JSON output schema; ask the model to return a structured intent object:
   ```json
   { "action": "list" | "cancel" | "reschedule",
     "dateRange": { "start": "ISO-8601", "end": "ISO-8601" },
     "filters": { "afterTime": "HH:MM", "practitionerId": "..." } }
   ```
4. **FHIR execution** — map the intent to `searchAppointments()` or `cancelAppointment()` in `src/lib/fhir/appointments.ts`; stream results back to the UI.
5. **Review step for mutations** — for `cancel` and `reschedule`, show a confirmation list of affected appointments before executing; never auto-cancel without user approval.

---

#### Use case 2 — Clinical-document generation from conversation transcript

The user pastes or dictates a clinician–patient conversation and prompts:
- *"Here is our conversation with my patient, prepare vital records, other types of observations, SOAP notes and let me review them"*

The LLM extracts structured clinical data and pre-fills the relevant forms for the user to review and confirm before any FHIR write.

**Implementation outline:**

1. **Transcript input dialog** — `src/components/llm/TranscriptDialog.tsx`; large textarea for pasting text, or a record-then-transcribe path (Web Speech API or a free STT service). Accessible from the encounter page action bar.
2. **API route** — `POST /api/llm/extract-clinical` receives `{ transcript, patientId, encounterId }`. The route strips identifying text before sending to the external LLM.
3. **LLM extraction prompt** — instruct the model to return a structured payload:
   ```json
   {
     "vitals": [{ "code": "8867-4", "display": "Heart rate", "value": 78, "unit": "bpm" }],
     "observations": [{ "category": "exam", "code": "...", "display": "...", "value": "..." }],
     "soap": { "subjective": "...", "objective": "...", "assessment": "...", "plan": "..." },
     "conditions": [{ "icd10": "J06.9", "display": "Upper respiratory infection" }],
     "medications": [{ "name": "Amoxicillin", "dose": "500 mg", "frequency": "TID", "duration": "7 days" }]
   }
   ```
4. **Review UI** — `src/components/llm/ExtractedClinicalReview.tsx`; tabbed view (Vitals · Observations · SOAP · Conditions · Medications) with edit-in-place for each field. A "Save all" button or per-section save buttons call the corresponding `create*` functions in `fhir-client.ts`.
5. **FHIR write** — only on explicit user confirmation; use existing domain functions (`createVitalSigns`, `createSOAPNote`, `createCondition`, etc.).

#### Recommended free LLM API

| Option | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** (`gemini-1.5-flash-8b` free tier) | 1 500 requests/day free; JSON mode (`responseMimeType: "application/json"`) ensures structured output; good multilingual support for AR/EN |
| **Groq** (Llama 3.1 8B / Mixtral free tier) | Very fast inference; generous free limits; good function-calling support |
| **Ollama** (local, self-hosted) | Zero cost, no PHI leaves the network; requires the clinic to run a local GPU/CPU server; ideal for production when PHI privacy is critical |

Store the API key in `.env.local` as `LLM_API_KEY` and the chosen provider as `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini | groq | ollama`. Abstract the call behind `src/lib/llm-client.ts` so the provider can be swapped without touching the API routes.

**PHI handling:** never log raw transcripts. Strip or pseudonymize patient name and ID before sending to any external API. Document the chosen model and data-processing agreement in the deployment runbook.
